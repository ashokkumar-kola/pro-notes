# Automatic linking with rnn-link

	React Native Navigation requires some manual native changes. To automate this process, use the rnn-link script.
	
	npx rnn-link













Update index.js 

import { Navigation } from "react-native-navigation";


+import { Navigation } from "react-native-navigation";
-import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';
import App from "./App";
-import {name as appName} from './app.json';

-AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
+Navigation.registerComponent('com.myApp.WelcomeScreen', () => App);

+Navigation.events().registerAppLaunchedListener(() => {
+   Navigation.setRoot({
+     root: {
+       stack: {
+         children: [
+           {
+             component: {
+               name: 'com.myApp.WelcomeScreen'
+             }
+           }
+         ]
+       }
+     }
+  });
