✅ **Great practical question!**
Let’s break it down step by step — both the **Linux command** *and* the **React Native CLI mobile over Wi-Fi concept**.

---

## 📌 **1️⃣ What does this command do?**

```bash
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="22d9", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android-usb.rules
```

**Parts:**

* `echo '...'` — outputs the text:

  ```
  SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="22d9", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
  ```
* `| sudo tee ...` — pipes (`|`) the output into `sudo tee ...`
  This writes the text **as root** to a new file:

  ```
  /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android-usb.rules
  ```

---

**What’s inside the rule?**
This is a **udev rule** — udev is Linux’s device manager.

* `SUBSYSTEM=="usb"` → Applies only to USB devices.
* `ATTR{idVendor}=="22d9"` → Matches any USB device with **Vendor ID `22d9`** (for example, Infinix/Realme/Some brands).
* `MODE="0666"` → Sets permissions: **read & write for everyone** (user/group/others).
* `GROUP="plugdev"` → Makes the device belong to the `plugdev` group.

---

✅ **Purpose:**
This makes the connected Android phone’s USB **accessible** to your user account without `sudo`.

If you **don’t set this**, `adb` might say:

> `no permissions (user in plugdev group; are your udev rules wrong?)`

So this rule says:

> When I plug in my phone, give `plugdev` group full access.

**After this, `adb` can talk to your phone freely**.

---

## 📌 **2️⃣ How does React Native CLI connect to a phone over USB or Wi-Fi?**

**Basic flow:**

1. `adb` (`Android Debug Bridge`) talks to your phone.
2. `adb` needs USB access → udev rule ensures you don’t need `sudo`.
3. React Native CLI uses `adb` under the hood:

   * **Builds** your `.apk` using Gradle.
   * **Pushes** the `.apk` to your phone via `adb install`.
   * **Starts** the app on your phone.
   * Runs a **Metro Bundler** server on your dev machine (port 8081).

---

### ✅ **How does Wi-Fi debug work?**

* **First, you connect your phone by USB**, run:

  ```
  adb tcpip 5555
  ```

  This tells your phone’s `adb` daemon to listen over TCP port `5555`.

* Next, find your phone’s IP:

  ```
  adb shell ip route
  ```

  or check Wi-Fi settings.

* Connect over Wi-Fi:

  ```
  adb connect <PHONE_IP>:5555
  ```

Now your phone is accessible **wirelessly**, `adb` tunnels all commands over Wi-Fi.

The React Native CLI just uses this `adb` link:

* Build → push → run → reload → logcat

---

## ✅ **Why do we do this?**

* The udev rule makes `adb` talk to the phone **without sudo**.
* Wi-Fi mode is great when you want to debug **without a cable**.
* Same `adb` server → same React Native Metro server → same live reload and fast refresh.

---

## 📌 **Key concept**

> **udev rule** → gives your user permissions for USB `adb`
> **adb over TCP** → enables wireless development
> **React Native CLI** → uses `adb` + Metro to install, bundle, push updates

---

## 🔑 **Summary**

| Part                 | Role                                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **udev rule**        | Makes USB accessible without root            |
| **adb**              | Core tool for installing, running, debugging |
| **Wi-Fi debug**      | Same `adb` works over TCP instead of USB     |
| **React Native CLI** | Automates `adb` + Metro + builds             |

---

So that single `udev` line removes **annoying permission errors**, making **plug & play** development smooth!
