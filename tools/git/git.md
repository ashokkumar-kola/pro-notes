## Introduction
- `Distributed Version Control System`

- `Version Control`
- `Collaboration`

- `Manage` projects with Repositories
- `Clone` a project to work on a local copy
- `Control` and `track` changes with Staging and Committing
- `Branch` and `Merge` to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
- `Pull` the latest version of the project to a local copy
- `Push` local updates to the main project

### VERSION CONTROL 

- `local Version Control`
- `Centralized Version Control System`
- `Distributed Version Control System`

---

## Installation & Setup
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git
    git --version
    ```

### Configure Git
git config --global user.name "sample-user"
git config --global user.email "sample@gmail.com"

Note: Use global to set the username and e-mail for every repository on your computer.
If you want to set the username/e-mail for just the current repo, you can remove global

To verify the configuration:
git config --list
    
---

## GIT INITIALIZATION

```bash
git init 
```

- Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/user/myproject/.git/

git status

- On branch master

- No commits yet

- Untracked files:
-   (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed)
-     index.html

- nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

---

# Git Staging Environment
- `Staged files are files that are ready to be committed to the repository you are working on.`

- `A README.md file that describes the repository (recommended for all repositories)`

git add index.html
git add --all
git add -A
git add .

git status
# On branch master

# No commits yet

# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached ..." to unstage)
#     new file: index.html


git restore --staged README.txt 

git reset logid

git stash
git stash pop
git stash clear

git diff
git diff --staged

---

# Git Commit
- Adding commits keep track of our progress and changes as we work. 
- `Git considers each commit change point or "save point".`
- `It is a point in the project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want to make a change.`
#
- `The -a option will automatically stage every changed, already tracked file.`
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- `Note: Short status flags are:`
    - `?? - Untracked files`
    - `A  - Files added to stage`
    - `M  - Modified files`
    - `D  - Deleted files`

git commit -m "First release of Hello World!"

# -m "message"- adds a message.

# [master (root-commit) 221ec6e] First release of Hello World!
#  3 files changed, 26 insertions(+)
#  create mode 100644 README.md
#  create mode 100644 bluestyle.css
#  create mode 100644 index.html


git commit -a -m "Updated index.html with a new line"
git commit -am "Updated index.html with a new line"

# [master 09f4acd] Updated index.html with a new line
# 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)


# Warning: Skipping the Staging Environment is not generally recommended.
# Skipping the stage step can sometimes make you include unwanted changes.

# 3. Branching and Merging
- `A branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.`

#
- ðŸ”¹ Key Benefits:
    - Enables parallel development.
    - Keeps the main branch stable.
    - Facilitates easy collaboration.
  
# Create a New Branch:
git branch <branch-name>

# View all branches
git branch

# Switch to a Branch:
git checkout <branch-name>
git switch <branch-name>

# Detached Head state - Switch to a Branch:
git checkout <id>

# Create and Switch in One Step:
git checkout -b <branch-name>
git switch -c <branch-name>

# Merge a Branch into Main:
git checkout main  # or git switch main
git merge <branch-name> 

# Resolving Merge Conflicts
git merge <branch-name>
git add <conflicted-file>
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"

# delete the branch
git branch -d <branch-name>


# Moves a branch to a new base (replaying commits)

git rebase <branch>

git rebase --continue

git push --force

### ðŸ”¹ Branching Strategies
<details>
<summary>ðŸ”¹ Branching Strategies</summary>
    <pre>
        A good branching strategy keeps the codebase clean and helps teams collaborate efficiently.
        1. Git Flow (Ideal for Large Teams)
            main: Stable production-ready code.
            develop: Integrates new features before release.
            feature/*: Each feature has its own branch (merged into develop).
            release/*: Prepares a new release.
            hotfix/*: Fixes critical issues in production.

        2. GitHub Flow (Simpler, Common for CI/CD)
            main: Always deployable.
            Create a feature branch, work on changes, and open a pull request (PR).
            After review, merge into main.

        3. Trunk-Based Development (Fast Development)
            Developers commit directly to main or short-lived branches.
            Continuous integration ensures stability.

        -ðŸ”¹ Which to Use?
            Use Git Flow for large projects with scheduled releases.
            Use GitHub Flow for fast, continuous deployment.
            Use Trunk-Based Development for frequent commits and minimal branches.
    </pre>
</details>

<details>
<summary>ðŸ”¹ Handling Large Files</summary>
    <pre>
        - Use .gitignore
        - Use Git LFS (Large File Storage)
            - git lfs install
            - git lfs track "*.psd" - Track specific file types
        - Use External Storage
    </pre>
</details>

---

# Ignore Files
- `A .gitignore file tells Git which files/folders to ignore.`

# Ignore system files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Ignore dependency folders
node_modules/
vendor/

# Ignore logs and environment files
*.log
.env


# ðŸ”¹ Create .gitignore in the root directory and commit it:
# touch .gitignore
# git add .gitignore
# git commit -m "Add .gitignore"

---

# Working with Remote Repositories

### Adding, Fetching, Pulling, and Pushing Changes to a Remote

# Adding a Remote Repository
git remote add origin <repository_url>

git remote -v # Verify remotes:

#  Fetching Changes from a Remote
git fetch origin

#  Pulling Changes from a Remote
git pull origin <branch-name>

# Pushing Changes to a Remote
git push origin <branch-name>

# First-time push for a new branch:
git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>
git push -u origin <branch-name>


### Discarding Changes in the Working Directory

# Discard Unstaged Changes (Modified but Not Added)
git checkout -- <file>

# Remove Staged Changes (Before Commit)
git reset HEAD <file>

# Discard All Uncommitted Changes
git reset --hard

# Remove Untracked Files and Folders
git clean -fd # -f (force) removes files, -d removes directories.


### Pull Request (PR) Workflow

# Create a Branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature

# Make Changes & Commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Push the Branch to Remote
git push origin feature/your-feature

# Open a Pull Request

# Reviewing PRs and Making Changes Based on Feedback
